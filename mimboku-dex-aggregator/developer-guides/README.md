# Developer Guides

The guides in the following section are targeted at application developers as well as smart contract integrators that are interested in building on top of the Mimboku Aggregator ecosystem.

## Overview

To cater for varying integration complexities, Mimboku Aggregator offers developers 2 options for integration:

* [**Aggregator API**](aggregator-api.md): For developers that require more fine-tuned control when integrating swap functionality within their app. If you're just getting started with the Mimboku Aggregator, you can refer to our [Execute A Swap With The Aggregator API](broken-reference) dev guide for information and code samples on how to query and execute swaps at the favourable rates.

Mimboku Aggregator implements a router contract which handles the complexity of routing and executing swaps atomically. Please refer to [Aggregator Contract Addresses](broken-reference) for the full list of contracts which have been deployed across the supported chains.
