# Connecting Your Wallet

## Getting Started

MimbokuSwap is a decentralized platform that doesn't rely on traditional user accounts. We don't store any personal data, and every interaction occurs through the use of Web3 wallets. Connecting your wallet unlocks all of MimbokuSwap’s features, allowing you to interact with the platform securely.

MimbokuSwap supports various wallet options. Please refer to the provider’s documentation for setup instructions.


## How to Connect Your Wallet

To begin, click the **Connect Wallet** button on the top right of the page. A selection of wallet connection options will appear.

Agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, then choose your preferred Web3 wallet and authorize the connection.

## Funding Your Wallet

All blockchain transactions require a small network fee, paid in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain (e.g., ETH for Ethereum, MATIC for Polygon). If your wallet doesn't have enough funds, you'll need to purchase some from an exchange and transfer them to your wallet.
