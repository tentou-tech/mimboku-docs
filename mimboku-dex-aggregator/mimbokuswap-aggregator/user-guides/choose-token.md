# Search for Your Favourite Tokens

## Introduction

MimbokuSwap whitelists some of the most commonly transacted tokens on our platform to view and trade. The interface remains consistent across various functions.

## Searching for Tokens

To begin, tap on the coin selector button to bring up the Token Selection screen. This screen lists all the whitelisted tokens by default, but you can use the search bar to look for a specific non-whitelisted token.

Enter either the **ticker symbol** or **contract address** of the token you wish to find.

Please proceed carefully when trading exotic tokens, as market conditions can change quickly. You may want to use the **Max Slippage** feature to protect your transactions.
